:egg: Instant search for twitch.tv

## **Note**

Because twitch's player is just now starting to shift completely away from flash, embedding any stream iframe will remove https from the site. Until they start serving their embedded content over SSL it will say this site is not secure, and you will have to manually enable the scripts in the address bar of your browser in order for the site to work.

Also most future updates will be most likely be random to non-existant.

## What is it?

This is a instant search for [twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/), a gaming/streaming website.
This project was heavily inspired by Google's instant search and of course [Youtube Instant](http://ytinstant.com/).

You can find the currently hosted version [here](https://brandonmanke.github.io/twitch-instant).

### Development has stopped

I have stopped the development of this side project because of the [twitch instant search update](https://blog.twitch.tv/find-what-you-want-faster-with-updated-search-b33121645ad6#.uq526flfa) a while ago. I feel bad leaving the project in this incomplete state, but I have lost a lot of motivation to work on it. I did learn a lot making it though, and it was a good experience.
