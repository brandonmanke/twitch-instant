:egg: Instant search for twitch.tv

## What is it?

This is a instant search for [twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/), a gaming/streaming website.
This project was heavily inspired by Google's instant search and of course [Youtube Instant](http://ytinstant.com/).

You can find the currently hosted version [here](https://brandonmanke.github.io/twitch-instant).

### Development has stopped

I have stopped the development of this side project because of the [twitch instant search update](https://blog.twitch.tv/find-what-you-want-faster-with-updated-search-b33121645ad6#.uq526flfa) a while ago. I feel bad leaving the project in this incomplete state, but I have lost a lot of motivation to work on it. I did learn a lot making it though, and it was a good experience.
